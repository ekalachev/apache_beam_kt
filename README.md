# Apache Beam Learning Project

This project is designed for learning and exploring various aspects of Apache Beam using Kotlin. It includes examples and exercises across different areas of data processing, such as streaming, batching, and more. The goal is to provide a hands-on approach to understanding and mastering `Apache Beam`.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into different areas, each focusing on a specific aspect of Apache Beam. Below is an overview of the current areas and what they cover:

### 1. Streaming

The [streaming](https://github.com/ekalachev/apache_beam_kt/blob/main/src/main/kotlin/streaming) section focuses on real-time data processing. You will find examples of how to create streaming pipelines, apply windowing, and write results to files.

- **Example Topics:**
  - Generating streaming data
  - Windowing and triggering
  - Writing streaming data to text files

### 2. Batches

The [batches](https://github.com/ekalachev/apache_beam_kt/tree/main/src/main/kotlin/batches) section covers batch processing techniques. It includes examples of how to handle large datasets, group data into batches, and perform batch transformations.

- **Example Topics:**
  - Grouping data into batches
  - Combining and aggregating batch data
  - Writing batch data to storage

### 3. Pub/Sub (Coming Soon)

The Pub/Sub section will focus on integrating Apache Beam with Pub/Sub systems for real-time messaging and event processing. This area will explore how to create pipelines that read from and write to Pub/Sub topics.

- **Example Topics:**
  - Setting up Pub/Sub topics and subscriptions
  - Reading from Pub/Sub in real-time
  - Writing processed data back to Pub/Sub

## Getting Started

To get started with the project:
